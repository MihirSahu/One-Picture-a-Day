# One-Picture-a-Day

The script I use to take a picture of myself every day when I log in to my desktop :). It's fun to go back and look at how much I've changed.

1. Configure the Windows Camera application's download folder. I set it to save all my pictures in a folder that's synced to the cloud.
2. Configure Windows to start the script either through the Startup Folder, Task Manager, Registry Editor, etc.
